Spread Operator (...)
The spread operator is used to "spread" the elements of an iterable (like an array, object, or string) into individual elements.


Rest Operator (...)
The rest operator is used to collect multiple elements into a single entity, usually an array.


Note : You can give default values when destructuring 

// For Arrays :

- Indexing is important
- variables are taken in order of the index

// For objects :

- Indexing not present 
- destructuring is done using keys
- name of the keys should be same
- keys can be renamed using ':' while destructuring.
